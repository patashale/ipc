Explanation 2 <p> To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted be committed or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence be caused. Illustrations <p> 1. A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.  2. A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation, stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3 <p> It is not necessary that the person abetted be capable by law of committing an offence or have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. Illustrations <p> 1. A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act that would be an offence if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence and having the same intention as A.

A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act that causes Z's death.

Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.  3. A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling house and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.  4. A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not act dishonestly and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. Explanation 4 <p> The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an offence is also an offence. Illustration <p> A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the same punishment as murder, and as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. Explanation 5 <p> It is not necessary for the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor coordinate the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. Illustration <p> A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A will administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C, mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence.

A shoots Z to kill him. Z dies as a consequence. A commits murder.  2. A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him to cause bodily injury. Z dies as a consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder if he did not intend to cause death or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.  3. A intentionally gives Z a sword cut or club wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies as a consequence.

A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. Exception 1 <p> When culpable homicide is not murder, culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, while deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. <p>The above exception is subject to the following provisos:  1. That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or harming any person.  2. That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such a public servant.  3. That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation <p> Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations <p> 1. A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, since the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.  2. Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here, A has not committed murder but merely culpable homicide.  3. A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited by the sudden and violent passion of the arrest and kills Z. This is murder, since the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.  4. A appears as a witness before Z, a magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words and kills Z. This is murder.  5. A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion as a consequence, and he kills Z. This is murder, since the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.  6. Z strikes B. B is excited by this provocation to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage and cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here, B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2 <p> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such a right of defence without premeditation or any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for such a defence. Illustration <p> Z attempts to horsewhip A, but not in such a manner as to cause grievous harm to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A, believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder but only culpable homicide. Exception 3 <p> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such a public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4 <p> Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted cruelly or unusually. Explanation <p> It is immaterial in cases where one party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5 <p> Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his consent. Illustration <p> A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his death; A has therefore abetted murder."},{"location":"en/301/","title":"IPC 301","text":""},{"location":"en/301/#culpable-homicide-by-causing-the-death-of-someone-other-than-the-person-whose-death-was-intended","title":"Culpable homicide by causing the death of someone other than the person whose death was intended","text":"If a person, by doing anything that he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of what it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause."},{"location":"en/302/","title":"IPC 302","text":""},{"location":"en/302/#punishment-for-murder","title":"Punishment for murder","text":"Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to a fine."},{"location":"en/303/","title":"IPC 303","text":""},{"location":"en/303/#punishment-for-murder-by-a-life-convict","title":"Punishment for murder by a life-convict","text":"Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for life, commits murder shall be punished with death."},{"location":"en/304/","title":"IPC 304","text":""},{"location":"en/304/#punishment-for-culpable-homicide-not-amounting-to-murder","title":"Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder","text":"Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years; or with a fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death."},{"location":"en/304A/","title":"IPC 304A","text":""},{"location":"en/304A/#causing-death-by-negligence","title":"Causing death by negligence","text":"Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both."},{"location":"en/304AA/","title":"IPC 304A","text":""},{"location":"en/304AA/#causing-death-or-injury-by-driving-any-vehicle-while-in-a-state-of-intoxication","title":"Causing death or injury by driving any vehicle while in a state of intoxication","text":"Whoever, while in a state of intoxication, drives or attempts to drive any vehicle and causes the death of any person not amounting to culpable homicide or causes any bodily injury likely to cause death, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine, as if the act by which death or bodily injury is caused is done with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death or cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.

Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here, A has caused cessation of motion in Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force on Z, and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z's consent, in order to commit an offence, A has used criminal force on Z.  4.

A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produces the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z or Z's clothes, A has used force on Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten, or annoy Z, he has used criminal force on Z.  6. A, intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force on her, and if he does so without her consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten, or annoy her, he has used criminal force on her.  7. Z is bathing. A, pours into the bath water, which he knows is boiling. Here A intentionally, by his own bodily power, causes such motion in the boiling water as to bring that water into contact with Z or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force on Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear, or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.  8. A incites a dog to spring upon Z without Z's consent.

Explanation 1 <p> A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft, but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. Explanation 2 <p> A move effected by the same act that effects the severance may be a theft. Explanation 3 <p> A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle that prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. Explanation 4 <p> A person who by any means causes an animal to move is said to move that animal and to move everything that, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. Explanation 5 <p> The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied and may be given either by the person in possession or by any person having for that purpose authority, either express or implied. Illustrations <p> 1. A cuts down a tree on Z's ground with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to do so, he has committed theft.  2. A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention is dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.  3. A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed the theft of the treasure.  4. A, being Z's servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate without Z's consent. A has committed theft.  5. Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z returns. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here, the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed a criminal breach of trust.  6. A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house that Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.  7. A finds a ring lying on the road, not in the possession of any person. By taking it, A commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.  8. A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here, A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.  9. A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here, A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.  10. If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  11. Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  12. A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.  13. A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.  14. A asks for charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food, and clothes, which A knows belong to Z, her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.  15. A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z and to be such property as she has not received authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.  16. A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft."},{"location":"en/379/","title":"IPC 379","text":""},{"location":"en/379/#punishment-for-theft","title":"Punishment for theft","text":"Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, with a fine, or with both."},{"location":"en/379A/","title":"IPC 379A","text":""},{"location":"en/379A/#snatching","title":"Snatching","text":"<ol> <li> Whoever, with the intention to commit theft, suddenly, quickly, or forcibly seizes, secures, grabs, or takes away from any person or from his physical possession any moveable property and makes or attempts to make an escape with such property is said to commit snatching. <li> Whoever attempts to commit snatching shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to ten years, and with a fine which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees. <li> Whoever commits snatching shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to ten years, and with a fine which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees. <li> Whoever, after committing or attempting to commit snatching, causes hurt or wrongful restraint of fear of hurt in order to effect his escape shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, in addition to the punishment provided for the offence of snatching by the preceding sub-sections."},{"location":"en/379B/","title":"IPC 379B","text":""},{"location":"en/379B/#snatching-after-preparation-is-made-for-causing-death-hurt-or-restraint-in-order-to-commit-snatching","title":"Snatching after preparation is made for causing death, hurt, or restraint in order to commit snatching","text":"Whoever commits or attempts to commit snatching, having made preparation for causing death, hurt, restraint, or fear of death, hurt, or restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such snatching, or in order to the retaining of property taken by such snatching, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to ten years, and with a fine which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees."},{"location":"en/38/","title":"IPC 38","text":""},{"location":"en/38/#persons-concerned-with-criminal-acts-may-be-guilty-of-different-offences","title":"Persons concerned with criminal acts may be guilty of different offences","text":"Where several persons are engaged in or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.

or <li> Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute, or alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any electronic record, knowing that such person, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication, cannot do so or that, by reason of deception practised upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration. Illustrations <p> 1. A has a letter of credit from B for 10,000 rupees, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds the cypher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 1,00,000 rupees, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  2. A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby obtaining from B the purchase money. A has committed forgery.  3. A picks up a cheque from a banker signed by B, payable to the bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.  4. A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable, and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.  5. A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.  6. Z's will contains these words: \"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B, and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.  7. A endorses a government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.  8. A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.  9. Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, he induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.  10. A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such a letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.  11. A, without B's authority, writes a letter and signs it in B's name, certifying A's character and intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z with the forged certificate and thereby induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. Explanation 1 <p> A man\u2019s signature on his own name may amount to forgery. Illustrations <p> 1. A, signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.  2. A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery, and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.  3. A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.  4. A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by annotating it.  5. A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give colour to the transaction, he writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. Explanation 2 <p> The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. Illustration <p> A draws a bill of exchange on a fictitious person and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such a fictitious person with the intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.

Explanation 1 <p> It may amount to defamation to impute anything to a deceased person if the imputation would harm the reputation of that person if living and is intended to hurt the feelings of his family or other near relatives. Explanation 2 <p> It may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company, an association, or a collection of persons as such. Explanation 3 <p> An imputation in the form of an alternative or expressed ironically may amount to defamation. Explanation 4 <p> No imputation is said to harm a person's reputation unless that imputation, directly or indirectly, in the estimation of others, lowers the moral or intellectual character of that person, or lowers the character of that person in respect of his caste or of his calling, or lowers the credit of that person, or causes it to be believed that the body of that person is in a lothsome state, or in a state generally considered disgraceful. Illustrations <p> 1. A says, \"Z is an honest man; he never stole B's watch,\" intending to cause it to be believed that Z did steal B's watch. This is defamation, unless it falls within one of the exceptions.  2. A is asked who stole B's watch. A points to Z, intending to cause it to be believed that Z stole B's watch. This is defamation, unless it falls within one of the exceptions.  3. A draws a picture of Z running away with B's watch, intending it to be believed that Z stole B's watch. This is defamation, unless it falls within one of the exceptions. Exception 1 <p> Imputation of truth, which a public good requires to be made or published: It is not defamation to impute anything that is true concerning any person if it is for the public good that the imputation be made or published. Whether or not it is for the public good is a question of fact. Exception 2 <p> Public conduct of public servants: It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of a public servant in the discharge of his public functions or respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct and no further. Exception 3 <p> Conduct of any person touching any public question: It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any public question and respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further. Illustration <p> It is not defamation for A to express in good faith any opinion whatever resembling Z's conduct in petitioning the government on a public question, in signing a requisition for a meeting on a public question, in presiding over or attending such a meeting, in forming or joining any society that invites the public's support, in voting for or canvassing for a particular candidate for any situation in the efficient discharge of the duties in which the public is interested. Exception 4 <p> Publication of reports of proceedings of courts: It is not defamation to publish a substantially true report of the proceedings of a court of justice or of the result of any such proceedings. Explanation 5 <p> A justice of the peace or other officer holding an inquiry in open court prior to a trial in a court of justice is a court within the meaning of the above section. Exception 5 <p> Merits of the case decided in court or conduct of witnesses and others concerned: It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the merits of any case, civil or criminal, which has been decided by a Court of Justice, or respecting the conduct of any person as a party, witness, or agent in any such case, or respecting the character of such a person, as far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further. Illustrations <p> 1. A says, \"I think Z's evidence on that trial is so contradictory that he must be stupid or dishonest.\" A is within this exception if he says this in good faith, inasmuch as the opinion which he expresses respects Z's character as it appears in Z's conduct as a witness, and no farther.  2. But if A says, \"I do not believe what Z asserted at that trial because I know him to be a man without veracity,\" A is not within this exception, inasmuch as the opinion that expresses Z's character is an opinion not founded on Z's conduct as a witness. Exception 6 <p> Merits of public performance: It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion respecting the merits of any performance that its author has submitted to the judgement of the public or respecting the character of the author so far as his character appears in such a performance, and no further. Explanation 6 <p> A performance may be submitted to the judgement of the public expressly or by acts on the part of the author that imply such submission to the judgement of the public. Illustrations <p> 1. A person who publishes a book submits that book to the judgement of the public.  2. A person who makes a speech in public submits that speech to the judgement of the public.  3. An actor or singer who appears on a public stage submits his acting or singing to the judgement of the public.  4. A says of a book published by Z, \"Z\u2019s book is foolish; Z must be a weak man. Z's book is indecent; Z must be a man of impure mind.\" A is within the exception if he says this in good faith, inasmuch as the opinion that he expresses of Z respects Z's character only so far as it appears in Z's book and no further.  5. But if A says, \"I am not surprised that Z's book is foolish and indecent, for he is a weak man and a libertine,\" A is not within this exception, inasmuch as the opinion that he expresses about Z's character is not founded on Z's book. Exception 7 <p> Censure passed in good faith by a person having lawful authority over another: It is not defamation for a person having over another any authority, either conferred by law or arising out of a lawful contract made with that other, to pass in good faith any censure on the conduct of that other in matters to which such lawful authority relates. Illustration <p> A judge censuring in good faith the conduct of a witness or of an officer of the court; a head of a department censuring in good faith those who are under his orders; a parent censuring in good faith a child in the presence of other children; a schoolmaster, whose authority is derived from a parent, censuring in good faith a pupil in the presence of other pupils; a master censuring a servant in good faith for remissness in service; a banker censuring in good faith the cashier of his bank for the conduct of such a cashier; are within this exception. Exception 8 <p> Accusation preferred in good faith to authorised person: It is not defamation to prefer in good faith an accusation against any person to any of those who have lawful authority over that person with respect to the subject-matter of the accusation. Illustration <p> If A in good faith accuses Z before a magistrate, if A in good faith complains of the conduct of Z, a servant, to Z's master, or if A in good faith complains of the conduct of Z, a child, to Z's father, A is within this exception. Exception 9 <p> Imputation made in good faith by a person for protection of his or another's interests: It is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another, provided that the imputation be made in good faith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, of any other person, or for the public good. Illustrations <p> 1. A, a shopkeeper says to B, who manages his business, \"Sell nothing to Z unless he pays you ready money, for I have no opinion of his honesty.\" A is within the exception if he has made this imputation on Z in good faith for the protection of his own interests.  2. A, a magistrate, in making a report to his own superior officer, casts an imputation on the character of Z. Here, if the imputation is made in good faith and for the public good, A is within the exception. Exception 10 <p> Caution intended for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed or for the public good: It is not defamation to convey a caution, in good faith, to one person against another, provided that such caution be intended for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed, of some person in whom that person is interested, or for the public good."},{"location":"en/5/","title":"IPC 5","text":""},{"location":"en/5/#certain-laws-are-not-affected-by-this-act","title":"Certain laws are not affected by this act","text":"Nothing in this act shall affect the provisions of any act for punishing mutiny and desertion of officers, soldiers, sailors, or airmen in the service of the Government of India or the provisions of any special or local law."},{"location":"en/50/","title":"IPC 50","text":""},{"location":"en/50/#section","title":"Section","text":"The word \u201csection\u201d denotes one of those portions of a chapter of this code which are distinguished by prefixed numeral figures."},{"location":"en/500/","title":"IPC 500","text":""},{"location":"en/500/#punishment-for-defamation","title":"Punishment for defamation","text":"Whoever defames another shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both."},{"location":"en/501/","title":"IPC 501","text":""},{"location":"en/501/#printing-or-engraving-matter-known-to-be-defamatory","title":"Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory","text":"Whoever prints or engraves any matter, knowing or having good reason to believe that such matter is defamatory of any person, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine, or with both."},{"location":"en/502/","title":"IPC 502","text":""},{"location":"en/502/#sale-of-printed-or-engraved-substances-containing-defamatory-matter","title":"Sale of printed or engraved substances containing defamatory matter","text":"Whoever sells or offers for sale any printed or engraved substance containing defamatory matter, knowing that it contains such matter, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine, or with both."},{"location":"en/503/","title":"IPC 503","text":""},{"location":"en/503/#criminal-intimidation","title":"Criminal intimidation","text":"Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation, or property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as a means of avoiding the execution of such a threat, commits criminal intimidation.

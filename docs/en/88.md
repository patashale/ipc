<div style="text-align: justify">

Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith and who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm or to take the risk of that harm.

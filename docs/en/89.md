        Illustration

        A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon, knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child's death but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception, inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.

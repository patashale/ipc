</div>

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide, not murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.

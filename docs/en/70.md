#### Fine leviable within six years of imprisonment. Death does not discharge property from liability
<div style="text-align: justify">

The fine, or any part thereof that remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within six years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable to imprisonment for a longer period than six years, then at any time prior to the expiration of that period; and the death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property that would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts.

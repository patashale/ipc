### Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done
<div style="text-align: justify">

If the act for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted and constitutes a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences.

</div>

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous harm to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both of these offences, and if A knew that B was likely to voluntarily cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress, A will also be liable to punishment for each of the offences.

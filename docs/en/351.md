### Assault
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever makes any gesture or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force on that person is said to commit an assault.

</div>

??? info "Explanation"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words that a person uses may give to his gestures or preparations such a meaning as to make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault.

??? example "Illustrations"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 1. A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A has committed an assault.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 2. A begins to unlatch the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault on Z.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 3. A takes up a stick, saying to Z, "I will give you a beating". Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture explained by the words may amount to an assault.

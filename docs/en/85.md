#### Act of a person incapable of judgement by reason of intoxication caused against his will
<div style="text-align: justify">

Nothing is an offence that is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing something that is either wrong or contrary to the law, provided that the thing that intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.

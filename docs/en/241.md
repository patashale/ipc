<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever delivers to any other person as genuine, or attempts to induce any other person to receive as genuine, any counterfeit coin which he knows to be counterfeit but which he did not know to be counterfeit at the time when he took it into his possession, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine to an amount which may extend to ten times the value of the coin counterfeited, or with both.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A, a coiner, delivers counterfeit company rupees to his accomplice B for the purpose of uttering them. B sells the rupees to C, another utterer, who buys them knowing they are counterfeit. C pays away the rupees for goods to D, who receives them, not knowing them to be counterfeit. D, after receiving the rupees, discovers that they are counterfeit and pays them away as if they were good. Here, D is punishable only under this section, but B and C are punishable under Section 239 or 240, as the case may be.

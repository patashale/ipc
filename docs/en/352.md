#### Punishment for assault or criminal force other than on grave provocation
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever assaults or uses criminal force against any person other than on grave and sudden provocation given by that person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, with a fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.

??? info "Explanation"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under this section if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the offence, if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such a public servant, or if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence is a question of fact.

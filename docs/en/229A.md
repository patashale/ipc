### Failure by a person released on bail or bond to appear in court

Whoever, having been charged with an offence and released on bail or on bond without sureties, fails without sufficient cause (the burden of proving which shall lie upon him) to appear in court in accordance with the terms of the bail or bond, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, with a fine, or with both.

    Explanation
    The punishment under this section is:
    1. in addition to the punishment to which the offender would be liable on a conviction for the offence with which he has been charged; and
    2. without prejudice to the power of the court to order forfeiture of the bond.

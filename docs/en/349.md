#### Force
<div style="text-align: justify">

A person is said to use force against another if he causes motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion as to bring that substance into contact with any part of that other's body, with anything that that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other's sense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described:

</div>

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> By his own bodily power
2. <div style="text-align: justify"> By disposing of any substance in such a manner that the motion, change, or cessation of motion takes place without any further act on his part or on the part of any other person.
3. <div style="text-align: justify"> By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move.

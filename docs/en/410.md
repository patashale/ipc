#### Stolen property
<div style="text-align: justify">

Property, the possession of which has been transferred by theft, extortion, or robbery, and property that has been criminally misappropriated or in respect of which a criminal breach of trust has been committed, is designated as stolen property, whether the transfer has been made or the misappropriation or breach of trust has been committed, within or without India. But if such property subsequently comes into the possession of a person legally entitled to its possession, it ceases to be stolen property.

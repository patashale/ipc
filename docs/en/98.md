### Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.
<div style="text-align: justify">

When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence by reason of the youth, the lack of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind, or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act as he would have if the act were that offence.

??? example "Illustrations"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> a. Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right to private defence that he would have if Z were sane.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> b. A enters by night a house to which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a housebreaker, attacks A. Here, Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z as he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception.

#### Murder
<div style="text-align: justify">

Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder if the act by which the death is caused is done to cause death, or one of the following:

</div>

- <div style="text-align: justify">  If it is done to cause such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused
- <div style="text-align: justify"> If it is done to cause bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,
- <div style="text-align: justify"> If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid

??? example "Illustrations"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 1. A shoots Z to kill him. Z dies as a consequence. A commits murder.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 2. A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him to cause bodily injury. Z dies as a consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder if he did not intend to cause death or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 3. A intentionally gives Z a sword cut or club wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies as a consequence. Here, A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 4. A, without any excuse, fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of people and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.

??? warning "Exception 1"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> When culpable homicide is not murder, culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, while deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.

    The above exception is subject to the following provisos:
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 1. That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or harming any person.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 2. That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such a public servant.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 3. That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

??? info "Explanation"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

??? example "Illustrations"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 1. A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, since the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 2. Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here, A has not committed murder but merely culpable homicide.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 3. A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited by the sudden and violent passion of the arrest and kills Z. This is murder, since the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 4. A appears as a witness before Z, a magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words and kills Z. This is murder.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 5. A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion as a consequence, and he kills Z. This is murder, since the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 6. Z strikes B. B is excited by this provocation to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage and cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here, B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.

??? warning "Exception 2"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such a right of defence without premeditation or any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for such a defence.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Z attempts to horsewhip A, but not in such a manner as to cause grievous harm to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A, believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder but only culpable homicide.

??? warning "Exception 3"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such a public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.

??? warning "Exception 4"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted cruelly or unusually.

??? info "Explanation"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> It is immaterial in cases where one party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.

??? warning "Exception 5"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his consent.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his death; A has therefore abetted murder.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A institutes a suit against Z. Z, knowing that A is likely to obtain a decree against him, fraudulently suffers a judgement to pass against him for a larger amount at the suit of B, who has no just claim against him, in order that B, either on his own account or for the benefit of Z, may share in the proceeds of any sale of Z's property that may be made under A's decree. Z has committed an offence under this section.

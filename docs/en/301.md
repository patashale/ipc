### Culpable homicide by causing the death of someone other than the person whose death was intended
<div style="text-align: justify">

If a person, by doing anything that he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of what it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.

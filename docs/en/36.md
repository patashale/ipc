### Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission
<div style="text-align: justify">

Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.

    Illustration

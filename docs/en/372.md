??? info "Explanation 1"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> When a female under the age of eighteen years is sold, let for hire, or otherwise disposed of to a prostitute or to any person who keeps or manages a brothel, the person so disposing of such a female shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have disposed of her with the intent that she shall be used for the purpose of prostitution.

??? info "Explanation 2"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> For the purposes of this section, "illicit intercourse" means sexual intercourse between persons not united by marriage or by any union or tie that, though not amounting to a marriage, is recognised by the personal law or custom of the community to which they belong or, where they belong to different communities, of both such communities as constituting between them a quasi-marital relation.

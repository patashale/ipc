#### Using a false property mark
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever marks any movable property or goods or any case, package, or other receptacle containing movable property or goods, or uses any case, package, or other receptacle having any mark thereon, in a manner reasonably calculated to cause it to be believed that the property or goods so marked, or any property or goods contained in any such receptacle so marked, belong to a person to whom they do not belong, is said to use a false property mark.

### Concealing design to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever, intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment, voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such an offence or makes any representation that he knows to be false respecting such a design.

</p>

If an offence be committed; if an offence be not committed, the offender shall, if the offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of the description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-fourth, and, if the offence be not committed, to one-eighth, of the longest term of such imprisonment, or with such a fine as is provided for the offence, or with both.

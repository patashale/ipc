#### Voluntarily causing grievous hurt
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said "voluntarily to cause grievous hurt".

</div>

??? info "Explanation"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A person is not said to have voluntarily caused grievous hurt except when he both causes grievous hurt and intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt. But he is said to cause grievous hurt voluntarily; if he intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt of another kind.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A, knowing himself to be likely to permanently disfigure Z's face, gives Z a blow that does not permanently disfigure Z's face but causes Z to suffer severe bodily pain for the space of twenty days. A has voluntarily caused grievous harm.

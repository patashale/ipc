### Liability of the abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted that is different from that intended by the abettor
<div style="text-align: justify">

When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A instigates B to cause grievous harm to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous harm to Z. Z dies as a consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder.

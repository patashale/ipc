#### Accident in doing a lawful act
<div style="text-align: justify">

Nothing is an offence that is done by accident or misfortune and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful means and with proper care and caution.

</div>

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> "A" is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of "A", his act is excusable and not an offence.

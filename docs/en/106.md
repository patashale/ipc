#### Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is a risk of harm to an innocent person
<div style="text-align: justify">

If, in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault that reasonably causes the apprehension of death, the defender is so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risking harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk.

</div>

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A person is attacked by a mob that attempts to murder him. He cannot effectively exercise his right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risking harming young children who are mingled with the mob. He commits no offence if, by so firing, he harms any of the children.

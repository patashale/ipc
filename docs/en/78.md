<div style="text-align: justify">

Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by, the judgement or order of a court of justice, if done while such judgement or order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding that the court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgement or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the court had such jurisdiction.

### Public nuisance
<div style="text-align: justify">

A person is guilty of a public nuisance if he or she does any act or is guilty of an illegal omission that causes any common injury, danger, or annoyance to the public or to the people in general who dwell or occupy property in the vicinity, or which must necessarily cause injury, obstruction, danger, or annoyance to persons who may have occasion to use any public right.

</p>

A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage.

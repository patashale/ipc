### Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure a conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment

Whoever gives or fabricates false evidence intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person to be convicted of an offence which by the law for the time being in force in India is not capital but punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of seven years or upwards, shall be punished as a person convicted of that offence would be liable to be punished.

    Illustration
    A gives false evidence before a court of justice, intending thereby to cause Z to be convicted of dacoity. The punishment for dacoity is imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term that may extend to ten years, with or without a fine. A, therefore, is liable to imprisonment for life or imprisonment, with or without a fine.

#### Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body
<div style="text-align: justify">

The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence, though the offence may not have been committed, and it continues as long as such an apprehension of danger to the body continues.

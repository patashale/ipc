#### Valuable security
<div style="text-align: justify">

The words "valuable security" denote a document that is, or purports to be, a document whereby any legal right is created, extended, transferred, restricted, extinguished, or released, or whereby any person acknowledges that he lies under legal liability or does not have a certain legal right.

</div>

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> A writes his name on the back of a bill of exchange. As the effect of this endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any person who may become the unlawful holder of it, the endorsement is a “valuable security”.

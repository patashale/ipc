### Exclusion of acts that are offences independently of harm caused
<div style="text-align: justify">

The exceptions in sections 87, 88, and 89 do not extend to acts that are offences independently of any harm that they may cause, be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent or on whose behalf the consent is given.

    Illustration
    
    Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith to save the life of the woman) is an offence independent of any harm that it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence because of such harm, and the consent of the woman or her guardian to the cause of such miscarriage does not justify the act.

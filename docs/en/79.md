### Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law
<div style="text-align: justify">

Nothing is an offence that is done by any person who is justified by law or who, because of a mistake of fact and not because of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law in doing it.

??? example "Illustration"
    <div style="text-align: justify"> "A" sees "Z" commit what appears to "A" to be a murder. "A", in the exercise, to the best of his judgement and in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in fact, seizes "Z" in order to bring "Z" before the proper authorities. "A" has committed no offence, though it may turn out that "Z" was acting in self-defence.

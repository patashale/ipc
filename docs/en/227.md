### Violation of the condition of remission of punishment
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whoever, having accepted any conditional remission of punishment, knowingly violates any condition on which such remission was granted, shall be punished with the punishment to which he was originally sentenced, if he has already suffered no part of that punishment, and if he has already suffered any part of that punishment, then with as much of that punishment as he has not already suffered.

### 👋 Introduction

First of all we would like to thank you for considering to know about our `IPC` project. We hope the detailed information below will help you explain most of your questions.

`IPC` project is created with intention to educate folks. It started because of several events in real world where we observed many folks used the "as per the law" or "as per the constition" in their speech and misguiding people or causing fear. We felt we need educate and we started to work. While we're brainstorming and researching on how should we execute this, we decide to order the book directly from government and we received this!

Yes, it was not up to date `IPC` as you can see in its cover page. That's ₹476 down the drain.

So we decide search on internet if government has made available any digital version of it and we found the [website](https://www.indiacode.nic.in). 

Although it was updated than what was available as physical books, it had its own challenges. To mention some:
 - it was not easy to search specific code
 - it was not few clicks away
 - it was wordy and not citizen friendly language
 - it consists of foot notes and amend highlights which as normal citizen does not need them
 - it was not easy to listen to using text-to-speech
 - grammar mistakes, missing code or section on the index
 - hyperlink missing on the index
 - inconsistent ordered list
 - amendments were multiple files as it was not merged or consolidated yet, etc.

So we decided that we need to create one and build ourself and also enable others to build education contents or tools on top of it such that it could truly be enabled for anyone to practice in the real world instantly and leverage in any technology.

Now we need to decide on what approach we need to take it make it truly digital, cost effective, people can easily contribute as well as can record every contribution, fix all the problems we faced on government published digital and physical version of the book, eventually attain versioning and release management that is consistent with release from Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India. Here is what we ended up choosing as tools for this project.

1. `GitHub` to solve source code management, versioning, releasing and seamless contribution that even law student can contribute through web.
2. `Material for MkDocs` to easily get the docs up and running without needing a contributor be technical person or software engineering background.
3. `Zoho Mail` as default email address for any contribute to have if they don't have their own `.in` domains.
4. `Slack` for collaboration and training.
5. `Grammarly` & `Quillbot` for grammar check using English UK as the language.
6. `Soho Meeting` for any meetings unto 60 minutes.
7. `GitHub Discussions` for anyone to share ideas, questions etc. through GitHub.
8. `LinkedIn Group` for anyone to share ideas, questions, share or get updates on Indian Penal Code especially those who are consumer and do not have GitHub account.


### 🎯 Objective

1. To educate people about Indian Penal Code at scale that is inline with objective of Patashale™
2. To integrate with external platforms were people interact most or real world situations with intent to practice the law proactively or reactively
